This ROS package adds the following display types to RViz:

- Detected persons (spencer_tracking_msgs/DetectedPersons)
- Tracked persons (spencer_tracking_msgs/TrackedPersons)
- Tracked groups (spencer_tracking_msgs/TrackedGroups)
- Social relations (spencer_social_relation_msgs/SocialRelations)
- Social activities (spencer_social_relation_msgs/SocialActivities)
- Human attributes (spencer_human_attribute_msgs/HumanAttributes)

These message types have been defined within the consortium of the SPENCER FP-7 European Research Project (http://www.spencer.eu).

See the "screenshots" folder for some example images of these displays.


Installation instructions
-------------------------
Just check out the package into the "src" folder of your ROS catkin workspace, run "catkin_make", make sure you have run
"source devel/setup.sh", and then run RViz using "rosrun rviz rviz". The plugin will be discovered automatically.

Usage
-----
Add displays for detected and tracked persons, groups or human attributes by clicking on "Add display" in the "Displays"
panel in RViz. Adjust the topic name if necessary, to point to the correct topic.

The displays for groups, social relations, and human attributes require two topic to be set in order to function,
the second topic being the tracked persons topic.

Known issues
------------
Rviz may crash with a segfault when exiting. This usually can be ignored.
Person visuals in the tracked groups and human attributes display do not support walking animations.
However, these displays can be combined with the tracked persons display (which does support animations) by disabling their person visuals.

Related work
------------
This Rviz plugin has been developed as part of the larger [SPENCER people tracking](https://github.com/spencer-project/spencer_people_tracking/) project and is provided here in a separate repository as a convenience for users that do not require the full human detection and tracking functionality (e.g. when using the PedSim simulator). We will try to keep this repository up-to-date with the upstream repository as far as possible. The original repository also contains references for citing
this work.
